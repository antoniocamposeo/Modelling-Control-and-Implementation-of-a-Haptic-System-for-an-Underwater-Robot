## Master Thesis Project - MODELLING, CONTROL, AND EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF A HAPTIC SYSTEM FOR AN UNDERWATER ROBOT 
The aim of the activity is to equip an underwater robot with a haptic system consisting of a flexible robotic antenna. The antenna is a prototype device built in the laboratories of the host University, and simulates the behaviour of the antennae and whiskers that some insects and mammals adopt to navigate in low-light environments, without the aid of vision. The aim of the system under development is to use the ROUV to inspect underwater surfaces by using the antenna. To this aim, different problems must be tacked and solved, including modelling and control of ROUV dynamics, motion planning, position control of the antenna, and estimation of interaction forces. Controlling the position of the position of the tip of the antenna, which can be represented as an infinite-dimensional multi-variable nonlinear system. Is a complex problem to solve due to interaction with environment and elasticity of the antenna as well. Therefore, an adequate approach in all the development phases, from the modelling of the system to the synthesis of the control algorithms is required. Innovative solutions will be explored to guarantee performance and robustness. â€‹
